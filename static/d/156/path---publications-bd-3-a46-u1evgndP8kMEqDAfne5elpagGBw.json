In this paper, we present a novel data-driven geometry compression method for static point clouds based on learned convolutional transforms and uniform quantization. We perform joint optimization of both rate and distortion using a trade-off parameter. In addition, we cast the decoding process as a binary classification of the point cloud occupancy map. Our method outperforms the MPEG reference solution in terms of rate-distortion on the Microsoft Voxelized Upper Bodies dataset with 51.5% BDBR savings on average. Moreover, while octree-based methods face exponential diminution of the number of points at low bitrates, our method still produces high resolution outputs even at low bitrates.","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08548","author":[{"family":"Quach","given":"Maurice"},{"family":"Valenzise","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Dufaux","given":"Frederic"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}
